# RaffleApplication
This template was generated by the **Aigonix Domain Assistant** to provide you with a starting-point for developing your .NET service. It includes a basic project structure and configuration to help you get up and running quickly.

## Domain
This is the prompt that was used for generating this template:
```
Name: Raffle Application
Description: A raffle application that allows participants to register with their email and earn up to 3 tickets by entering secret words. The winner is chosen based on the number of tickets they have.

Requirements:
- Participants can register with their email.
- Participants can enter up to 3 secret words to earn tickets.
- The system will keep track of each participant's ticket count and the total number of tickets issued.
- Participants can only see their own ticket count and the total number of tickets issued.
- The winner can be drawn by posting to a specific path, which emits a "winner-drawn" event with the timestamp and winner information.
- Multiple draws can happen without any consequence, and the user can find their own draw by timestamp later.
- The secret words can be seeded with dummy words initially, and the user can update the string-array in the aggregate later.

```

The magic space-elves has done their best, but keep in mind that this is just a starting point.
You can modify the domain, project structure and configuration to suit your needs.

Sometimes the space-elves get a little excited and forget a few dependencies or use some code that doesn't exist yet, you might have to do some light clean-up after them.

Have fun!

## Getting Started
 To move on from this starting-point follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Install .NET 7 SDK if you haven't already.
3. Open the project in your favorite IDE or editor.
4. Start the runtime
5. Start the service
6. figure out what to add or remove
7. iterate towards success!

### Configuration
The configuration of your service is stored in the appsettings.json file. You can modify this file to set various settings such as database connection strings, API keys, or any other configuration values specific to your service.

## Building and Running
To build and run the DotNet Service Template, follow these steps:

### Ensure that the runtime is up
1. Install Docker
2. Run the following command to start the runtime:
```shell
.\Runtime\docker compose up -d
```

### Build the project
Navigate to the Source/Hosting directory.
Run the following command to build the project:

```shell
dotnet build
```
After a successful build, run the following command to start the service:
```shell
dotnet run
```

Open your web browser and visit http://localhost:5000 to see the running service.
